I received a Bachelor's (Minor in CS) and Master's Degree from the LMU Munich, where I also obtained a PhD at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.en.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) in 2018, with focus on Survival Analysis. I then spent 8 months in Oxford as PotDoc at the [Big Data Institute](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/). At the end of 2019 I returned to my alma mater, with a stronger focus on machine learning in research and application.

My [research](https://profiles.impactstory.org/u/0000-0002-8082-1890) focused on health-related applications of Natural Language Processing-based methods, and was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute, and Autism Speaks. I have written numerous scientific [publications](/publication) on autism and neurodevelopmental disorders and have presented my research at over 25 international conferences.

While at OHSU, I became an avid user of the statistical programming language R, both in the lab as a Principal Investigator and in the classroom as a professor. I developed a passion for programming and education, and during my tenure at OHSU I developed and taught multiple graduate-level [data science courses](/categories/course/) and [workshops](/categories/workshop/).

I also trained the [Office of Research Impact at the Oregon Clinical & Translational Research Institute](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/octri/) to use R, and consulted with the University of Oregon College of Education on the development of a [graduate data science specialization track](https://education.uoregon.edu/). I received an [Excellence in Education award](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/honors-and-awards-ceremony-2018-school-medicine) from OHSU in 2018.

My teaching materials have been used by [NASA](https://open.nasa.gov/explore/datanauts/), [Pew Research Center](https://medium.com/pew-research-center-decoded/using-tidyverse-tools-with-pew-research-center-survey-data-in-r-bdfe61de0909), [University of Oregon](https://github.com/uo-datasci-specialization), and now [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). I am also a co-author of the book [_blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown_](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).


Thank you so much for reading.
