<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08080"><strong><code>mlr3proba</code></strong></a> is an add-on package in the <strong><code>mlr3</code></strong> universe that provides support for probabilistic regression. In this paper we focus on itâ€™s capabilities for machine learning based survival analysis. <strong><code>mlr3proba</code></strong> provides a clean interface to many learners and their evaluation using different measures (see <a href="https://mlr3proba.mlr-org.com/">here</a> for an overview). The paper is available here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08080" class="uri">https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08080</a></p>
