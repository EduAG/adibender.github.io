Today I joined the [LMU Open Science Center](https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/index.html). (Privately) I've been an advocate of open and reproducible research for a long time and shared code as well as data of our analyses whenever possible. By joining the LMU-OSC, I wanted to make [my support for open science](https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/members/individual-members/bender/index.html) official and hope to contribute to the overall goal of the center in the upcoming years.
