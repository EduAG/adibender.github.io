Our paper ["A General Machine Learning Framework for Survival Analysis"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15442) has been accepted for publication in the research track at [ECML PKDD 2020](https://ecmlpkdd2020.net/).

The framework is general in that it transforms many different survival tasks (e.g. left-truncation, time-varying effects, multi-state models, etc.) to "standar" Poisson regression tasks. Any algorithm and implementations thereof can therefore be used to perform different survival tasks.
