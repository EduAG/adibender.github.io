<p>Our paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15442">“A General Machine Learning Framework for Survival Analysis”</a> has been accepted for publication in the research track at <a href="https://ecmlpkdd2020.net/">ECML PKDD 2020</a>.</p>
<p>The framework is general in that it transforms many different survival tasks (e.g. left-truncation, time-varying effects, multi-state models, etc.) to “standar” Poisson regression tasks. Any algorithm and implementations thereof can therefore be used to perform different survival tasks.</p>
