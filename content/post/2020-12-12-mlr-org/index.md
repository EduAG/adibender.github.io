Today I officially joined the [mlr-org](https://github.com/sponsors/mlr-org).
The main goal of the organization is development of open source software that facilitate the entire process of machine learning in **R** (MLR). The main package is **`mlr3`**, however, the **`mlr3`** ecosystem has been growing steadily since its inception and features many add-on packages that facilitate different tasks (e.g., tuning, benchmarking, pipelines, survival analysis, ...).

I have contributed to **`mlr3`** and particularly to **`mlr3proba`** since I joined the chair of [statistical learning and data science](https://www.slds.stat.uni-muenchen.de/). Now I officially joined the organization as one of the full members and sponsor (1$/month).

If you want to get started with **`mlr3`** consider the

- **`mlr3book`**: https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/ or
- **`mrl3gallery`**: https://mlr3gallery.mlr-org.com/
