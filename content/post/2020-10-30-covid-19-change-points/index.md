In [this preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.29.20222265v1), we analyse the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany and particularly in Bavaria. Using segmented regression, we identify change points in the epidemic curve and compare them to the various measures implemented by the federal and regional governments.

Updates, including change point analyses of the second wave and further COVID-19 related analyses are available from the [Newsletter](https://www.covid19.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/newsletter/index.html) (German only) of the *Covid-19 Data Analysis Group (CODAG)* at the Department of Statistics at LMU Munich
