A big new update of **R** package **`pammtools`** has been released on CRAN shortly before the holidays. In addition to some smaller fixes and updates, the main new features are implemented in the `as_ped` function. The new updates facilitate
survival analysis in the context of

- [Left-truncation](https://adibender.github.io/pammtools/articles/left-truncation.html),
- [Competing risks](https://adibender.github.io/pammtools/articles/competing-risks.html) and
- [Recurrent events](https://adibender.github.io/pammtools/articles/recurrent-events.html)

The links below provide example applications to get started. The ability to provide `Surv(start, stop, event)` type objects to `as_ped` is also the first step to support more general multi-state models, which will be implemented in the next step.
