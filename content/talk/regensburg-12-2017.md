title = "Penalized estimation of complex, non-linear Exposure-Lag-Response Associations"
abstract = "Modeling effects of time dependent covariates (TDC) introduces additional complexity to time-to-event analysis, especially when these effects are assumed to depend on the complete or partial history of the TDC. Such effects are often referred to as cumulative effects. We present a general framework for penalized estimation of such effects, that potentially vary non-linearly with respect to timing and amount of the TDC as well as over time. We illustrate the proposed method, by investigating the association between daily caloric intake on the intensive care unit and acute survival in critically ill patients."
