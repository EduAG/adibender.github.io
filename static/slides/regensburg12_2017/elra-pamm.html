# Motivation
What are **Exposure-Lag-Response Associations**?

- The term *Exposure* is often used in epidemiology to describe
(environmetal) variables to which subjects are *exposed* to (usually an
*external* variable outside of the subjects' control)

- *Lag* is the time between exposure and its effect on the response/outcome

`\(\ra\)` We use **Exposure-Lag-Response Associations (ELRA)** as a general term
that describes how an exposure affects the *response/outcome*,
possibly *after some temporal delay*


---
# Motivation (2)
- Patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) are in need of
artificial nutrition

- At the same time, the association between amount of calories provided and
health outcomes is unclear

  - Body needs energy for recovery instead of digestion &lt;br&gt;
  (→suggests feeding less than goal calories)

  - Recovery costs energy and needs building blocks &lt;br&gt;
  (→suggests feeding close to goal calories)

  - Different results from different observational studies

  - Differing guidelines in Europe and North America
  with respect to the recommended amount

---
# Motivation (3)
  - Multi-center study of critical care patients from 457 ICUs
  ( `\(\approx 10k\)` patients)

  - maximum follow up of 60 days
  (we only consider short term survival `\(t\leq 30\)`)

  - Various confounders:
    - Age, Gender, BMI
    - Diagnosis, Admission Category
    - year of ICU admission
    - Apache II Score
    - ICU random effect

  - **11-day nutrition protocol**
    - prescribed calories (determined at baseline `\(t=0\)`)
    - *daily* caloric intake
    - daily **caloric adequacy (CA)** = caloric intake/prescribed calories

---
# Motivation (4)
- We are interested in how artificial nutrition (*exposure*) affects short
term survival (*outcome*)

- Difficulty:
  - effect of nutrition might have a temporal delay
  (e.g. nutrition today affects survival 4 days later)

  - effect of nutrition might "wear off" after some time
  (e.g. nutrition on day 1 likely won't affect the hazard on day 30)

  - the (delayed) effect of nutrition also depends on the amount of nutrition
  (caloric adequacy) provided, possibly non-linearly

  - the same amount of exposure might have a different effect depending on
  the follow up and exposure time

  - the effect may be *cumulative* (i.e., 5 days of malnutrition in a row may
  be worse than only 2 in a row or 5 days malnutrition scattered throughout the
  follow up while on the other days "correct" amount was provided)


---
# Terminology
We use the following terminology and notation:

- **Time-to-event `\(t\)`**: Time at which event times are observed

- **Time of exposure `\(\te\)`**: Time at which values of the exposure are observed
(must not necessarily overlap temporally with `\(t\)`, measured in the same units
or be in the same domain as `\(t\)`, e.g. calendar days ( `\(\te\)`) vs. 24h periods
(days) since admission to ICU `\(t\)`)

- **time-varying *effects* (TVE)**: Effects of time-constant covariates (covariates
observed at the beginning of the follow-up) that can vary over time `\(t\)`

- **time-dependent *covariates* (TDC)**: Covariates whose values change over time.
Value changes are recorded at exposure time `\(\te\)` (here synonymous to *exposure*)

- **Exposure value `\(z(\te)\)`**: The value of the TDC observed at exposure time
`\(\te\)`

- **Exposure history `\(\mathbf{z}\)`**: The complete history of observed
values of the exposure/TDC `\(\mathbf{z}= (z(t_{e,1}), z(t_{e,2}), ..., z(t_ {e,Q}))\)`

  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Time-to-event `\(t\in (0, t_{max}]\)` &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Time from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) until death
    in days (24h periods); `\(t\in (0, 30]\)`&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Time of exposure `\(t_e \in \{1,2,...,11\}\)`, &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;calendar&lt;/i&gt; days 1 - 11 after admission to ICU at which artificial
     nutrition was administered (and recorded)&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;time-varying effects (TVE)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Apache II Score, ...&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;time-dependent covariates (TDC)&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Exposure value `\(z(t_{e,1})=25\%\)`&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Caloric adequacy administered on day 1 was 25% &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Exposure history `\(\bfz = (z(t_{e,1})=25\%, ..., z(t_{e,11})=100\%)\)`&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Caloric adequacy on days 1-11 after ICU admission administered on the
    ICU &lt;br&gt;(Day 1: 25%, ..., Day 11: 100% )&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

# Caloric Intake
&lt;img src="image/nutri-hist.jpg"&gt;


---
# Terminology (3)
**A general ELRA/cumulative effect** can be defined as
.code150[
`$$g(\mathbf{z}, t) = \int_{\te: \te &lt; t}h(t, \te, z(\te))\mathrm{d}\te$$`
]
- **Partial effects `\(h(t,\te,z(\te))\)`**: The effect of the TDC recorded at
exposure time `\(\te\)` with value `\(z(\te)\)` on the hazard at follow up time `\(t\)`
(the tri-variate function `\(h\)` is potentially non-linear in all three dimensions)

- **Cumulative effect `\(g(\mathbf{z}, t)\)`**: The total (cumulated) effect of the
partial effects on the log-hazard at time `\(t\)` given exposure history `\(\bfz\)`

- The integral must be approximated numerically (e.g., trapezoidal
rule/weighted sum)

---
# Terminology (4)
The integration borders can be defined more general, such that
`$$g(\mathbf{z}, t) = \int_{t-\tlag - \tlead}^{t-\tlag}h(t, \te, z(\te)) \mathrm{d}\te=\int_{\tw}h(t, \te, z(\te)) \mathrm{d}\te$$`
- **Lag time `\(\tlag\)`**: The length of the delay until the TDC recorded at
exposure time `\(\te\)` starts to affect the hazard (often `\(t_{lag}=0\)`)
- **Lead time `\(\tlead\)`**: The duration of the effect of the TDC at time `\(\te\)`
- `\(\tlag\)` and `\(\tlead\)` define the set of exposures that contribute to the
cumulative effect at time `\(t\)` as `\(\{z(\te): \te \in [t-\tlag - \tlead, t-\tlag]\}\)`
- Example ( `\(\tlag = 4\)`, `\(\tlead = 3\)`):
  - The last nutrition that will enter the cumulative effect at
  time `\(t=10\)` is nutrition at `\(\te \leq t - \tlag = 10-4=6\)`, i.e. `\(z(t_{e}=6)\)`
  - The earliest nutrition that will contribute to the cumulative effect at time
  `\(t=10\)` is nutrition at `\(\te \geq t - \tlag - \tlead = 10 - 4 - 3 = 3\)`
- [Minimal requirement (never condition on the future)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.4385/abstract) `\(\te \leq t\)` follows
from &lt;br&gt; `\(\tlag=0\)` and `\(\tlead=t\)`

# Lag-Lead Window
Two exemplary specifications of `\(\tlag\)` and `\(\tlead\)`:

&lt;a href="image/lagLeadWindow.jpg" align="middle"&gt;
  &lt;img class="center" height = "450" src="image/lagLeadWindow.jpg"
  align="middle"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

---
# Exposure-Lag-Response Association
- the ELRA `\(g(\bfz, t)\)` represents the cumulative, time-varying effect of
exposure history `\(\bfz\)` on the log-hazard at time `\(t\)`

- we define its contribution to the model's additive predictor as

`\begin{align}
g(\bfz_i, t) = \int_{\tw} h(\tilde t_j, \te, z_i(\te)) \mathrm{d}\te
  \approx
    \sum_{q: t_{e,q} \in \tw} \Delta_{q}
      h(\tilde t_j, t_{e,q}, z_i(t_{e,q}))
        \quad\forall\, t \in (\kappa_{j-1}, \kappa_j],
\end{align}`

with
  - `\(\tilde{t}_j:= (\kappa_j - \kappa_{j-1})/2, j=1,\ldots, J\)`
  - partial effects `\(h(\tilde t_j, \te, z_i(\te))\)`
  - quadrature weights `\(\Delta_{q} = t_{e,q} - t_{e,q-1}\)` for numerical integration are given by the time between two consecutive exposure measurements

---
# Exposure-Lag Response Association (2)
- If we restrict the ELRA to be linear in the exposure, i.e.,
`\(h(z_i(\te), \te, t) = \tilde h(\te, t)\cdot z_i(\te)\)` we can simplify to
`$$g(\bfz_i, t) \approx \sum^Q_{q=1} \tilde\Delta_{i,q} \tilde h(t_{e,q}, t)$$`
with
`$$\tilde\Delta_{i,q} = \begin{cases}
  z_i(t_{e,q})\Delta_{q} &amp; \text{ if } t_{e,q} \in \tw\\ 0
  &amp; \text{ else} \end{cases}$$`


---
# Exposure-Lag Response Association (3)
- spline bases for the bivariate functions `\(\tilde h(\te, t)\)` are set up
via tensor product B-spline basis with marginal bases
`\(B_{m}(\te), m=1,\dots,M\)` and `\(B_{k}(t), k=1,\dots,K\)` defined over the exposure and
hazard time domains, respectively.
- `\(M\)` and `\(K\)` delimit the maximal complexity of the ELRA over `\(\te\)` and `\(t\)`,
respectively
- `\(\tilde h(\te, t) =  \sum_{m=1}^{M}\sum_{k=1}^{K} \gamma_{m,k}B_{m}(\te)B_{k}(t)\)`

- Combining above equations yields:
`\begin{align}
g(\bfz_i, t) \approx \sum_{m=1}^{M}\sum_{k=1}^{K} \gamma_{m,k} \tilde B_{i, m}(\te, t) B_{k}(t),
\end{align}`
where  `\(\tilde B_{i, m}(\te, t) = \sum^Q_{q=1} \tilde\Delta_{i, q} B_{m}(\te)\)`.



---
# ELRAs in the literature
Some models known from the literature follow as special cases of the general
specification
`$$g(\mathbf{z}, t) = \int_{\mathcal{T}_e(t)}h(t, t_e, z(t_e))$$`

when we assume that partial effects `\(h\)` only depend on *latency* `\(t-\te\)`
instead of concrete combination of `\(t\)` and `\(\te\)`, i.e.,
`\(h(t=30, \te=3)\stackrel{!}{=}h(t=40,\te=13)\stackrel{!}{=}\tilde{h}(t-\te=27)\)`

- DLNM: Distributed Lag Non-linear Models (Gasparrini et al,
[2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.5963/abstract),
[2017](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/biom.12645/abstract)):
`\(g(\mathbf{z}, t) = \int_{\mathcal{T}_e(t)}h(t - t_e, z(t_e))\)`


- WCE: Weighted Cumulative Exposure ([Sylvestre and Abrahamowicz, 2009](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.3701/abstract)):
`\(g(\mathbf{z}, t) = \int_{\mathcal{T}_e(t)}h(t - t_e)z(t_e)\)`

- Also possible within general framework:
  - time-varying WCE (TV WCE):
  `\(g(\mathbf{z}, t) = \int_{\mathcal{T}_e(t)}h(t, t_e)z(t_e)\)`
  - time-varying DLNM (TV DLNM):
  `\(g(\mathbf{z}, t) = \int_{\mathcal{T}_e(t)}h (t, t - t_e, z(t_e))\)`


---
# Model Specification
Let `\(i=1,\ldots,n\)` the index of subjects in the data set with
[confounders](ercim-pamm.html#6) `\(x_{i,p}, p=1,\ldots,P\)` and
exposure histories `\(\mathbf{z}_i\)`. We model the log-hazard of
experiencing an event at time `\(t\)` as

`$$\log(\lambda(t|\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{z}_i, \ell_i)) = f_0(t) + \sum_{p=1}^P f_p (x_{i,p}, t) + g(\mathbf{z}_i,t) + b_{\ell_i}$$`

where
- `\(f_{0}(t_j)=\sum_{m=1}^{M}\gamma_{0m}B_m(t_j)\)` represents the log baseline-hazard
- `\(f(x_{i,p},t_j)=\sum_{m=1}^M\sum_{\ell=1}^{L}\gamma_{m\ell}B_m(x_{i,p})B_\ell (t_j)\)` are potentially non-linear, potentially non-linearly time-varying effects
- of confounders `\(x_{i,p}\)`
- `\(g(\mathbf{z}_i,t)\)` is the cumulative effect of
[subject `\(i\)`'s nutrition protocol](ercim-pamm.html#10) `\(\mathbf{z}_i\)`
- `\(b_{\ell_i}\)` is the random effect associated with ICU (cluster) `\(\ell_i\)`
at which subject `\(i\)` is treated


---
# Estimation

 - We know how the estimate such models in the framework of &lt;br&gt;
[**G**eneralized **A**dditive **M**ixed **M**odels (**GAMM**s)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/index.html)

- Fortunately, we can represent survival models as Poisson GLMs/GAMMs by
representing them as a
[**P**iece-wise exponential **A**dditive **M**ixed **M**odel (**PAMM**s)](https://adibender.github.io/pammtools/)

- to do so requires to
  - decompose the follow up `\((0, t_{max}]\)` into `\(J\)` intervals
with `\(J+1\)` cut-points `\(0 = \kappa_0 &lt; \ldots &lt; \kappa_J = t_{\max}\)`
  - [transform the data into appropriate format](https://adibender.github.io/pammtools/articles/data-transformation.html) (pseudo observations in
  each interval):
      - interval specific event-indicators `\(\delta_{ij}\)`, where `\(\delta_{ij}=1\)`
  if subject `\(i\)` experienced an event in interval `\(j\)` (i.e.
  `\(t_i\in (\kappa_{j-1}, \kappa_j]\)` and `\(T_i &lt; C_i\)`) and `\(\delta_{ij}=0\)` else
      - offsets `\(o_{ij} = \log(t_{ij})\)`, where
  `\(t_{ij}=min(t_i - \kappa_{j-1}, \kappa_{j}-\kappa_{j-1})\)` is the time
  subject `\(i\)` spent in interval `\(j\)`
  - in the `\(j^{th}\)` interval `\((\kappa_{j-1}, \kappa_j]\)` estimate a
  &lt;a href=image/weibull-hazard-ex.jpg&gt; piece-wise constant hazard rate &lt;/a&gt;
`\(\lambda(t) = \lambda_{j}\ \forall\ t\in (\kappa_{j-1},\kappa_j]\)`
(more intervals lead to better approximation)

# Simulation
- Simulations studies (on the estimation of ELRAs) yielded promising results
- here we simulated survival times based on a DLNM model
`\(\lambda(t|\bfz) = \lambda_0(t)\exp(\int h(t-\te, z(\te))\mathrm{d}\te)\)`

&lt;img src="image/pam_wce_dlnm_dlnm.jpg"&gt;

---
# Simulation (2)
Data based on TV DLNM with `\(\lambda(t|\bfz) = \lambda_0(t)\exp(\int h(t, t-\te, z(\te)) \mathrm{d}\te)\)`
&lt;a href="image/fit-vs-truth-ped.gif" align="middle"&gt;
  &lt;img class="center" height = "550"
  src="image/pam_dlnm_tvdlnm_tvdlnm_horiz.jpg"
  align="middle"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

---
# Application (2)
- The nutrition variable has a catch

- Actual caloric intake during the first 11 days comprises from
  - parenteral nutrition
  - enteral nutrition
  - Propofol (sedative)
  - .warning[additional oral intake (!)]

`\(\ra\)` how should oral intake be incorporated?

`\(\ra\)` we decided to discretize the nutrition variable


---
# Application (3)

- **caloric intake** = calories from EN + PN + PF

- **caloric adequacy (CA)**:&lt;br&gt;
`\(CA (\%) = \text{caloric intake} / \text{prescribed calories} \cdot 100\)`

- **discretized caloric adequacy (in 3 categories)**:
  - `\(\CI\)`: `\(0\% \leq CA &lt; 30\%\)` and no OI
  - `\(\CII\)`:
      - `\(30\% \leq CA &lt; 70\%\)` and no OI *or*
      - `\(0\% \leq CA &lt; 30\%\)` and additional OI
  - `\(\CIII\)`:
      - `\(CA \geq 70\%\)` *or*
      - `\(30\% \leq CA &lt; 70\%\)` and additional OI

---
# Application (4)
- The model specification thus contains 2 ELRA terms

`\begin{align}
  \log\left(\lambda_i(t|\bfx_i, \bfz_i, \ell_i)\right)
    &amp; = f_0(t) +
        \sum_{p=1}^P f_p(x_{i,p}, t) + g(\bfz_i, t) + b_{\ell_i}
\end{align}`

with
- `\(g(\bfz_i, t) =g_{\CII}(\bfz_i^{\CII},t) + g_{\CIII}(\bfz_i^{\CIII}, t)\)`
   - `\(\bfz_i^{\CII}\)` and `\(\bfz_i^{\CIII}\)` dummy variables that indicate whether
subject `\(i\)` received category `\(\CII\)` and `\(\CIII\)` nutrition on day
`\(t_{e,q},q=1,\ldots,11\)`, respectively
  - `\(g_{\CII}(\bfz_i,t) \approx \sum^Q_{q=1} \tilde\Delta_{i,q}^{\CII} \tilde h_ {\CII}(t_{e,q}, t)\)`


`\(\ra  \CI\)` reference category


---
# Application (Results)

&lt;a href="image/ELRA_heatmaps.jpg" align="middle"&gt;
  &lt;img class="center" height = "550" src="image/ELRA_heatmaps.jpg"
  align="middle"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;


---
# Application (Results 2)

These bivariate surfaces are difficult to interpret as

- they must be interpreted with respect to a subject who received
`\(\CI\)` nutrition on all 11 days of nutrition protocol

- partial effects `\(h_{\CII}(t,\te)\)` and `\(h_{\CIII}(t,\te)\)` can both contribute
to the cumulative effect, depending on the specific nutrition profile

- for these reasons, we prefer to analyze and interpret estimated
hazard ratios between hypothetical patients with different clinically
relevant exposure histories ( `\(\bfz_1\)` and `\(\bfz_2\)`)

`\begin{equation}
e_j= \frac{\lambda(\tilde t_j|\bfz_2)}{\lambda(\tilde t_j|\bfz_1)}
\end{equation}`


---
# Application (Results 3)
We compare the following nutrition profiles:

&lt;img class = "center" src="image/comparisons-definition.png"&gt;



---
# Application (Results 4)
`\(\ra\)` Complete, mildly hypocaloric nutrition reduces risk of mortality
compared to a complete, severely hypocaloric nutrition (Comparison B)

`\(\ra\)` No further risk reduction when moving from mildly hypocaloric to
partial or complete near target nutrition (Comparisons E, F)

`\(\ra\)` Sensitivity analyses (Imputation of missing protocols,
lag/lead specification, penalty structure, ...) show no substantive deviation
from main results

&lt;a href="image/maint1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;img class="center" src="image/maint1.jpg" width="50%"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;


---
# Limitations (and outlook)

- currently, `\(\tlag\)` and `\(\tlead\)` must be specified a priori
`\(\ra\)` would be nice if the lag-lead window could be selected data-driven
(e.g. Obermeier et al., 2015)

- we assume that patients released from hospital survived until the end
of the follow-up ( `\(t=30\)` ). Sensitivity analysis with hospital discharge
as censoring event do not change the results
`\(\ra\)` Competing risks model for outcomes *hospital discharge* and
*death* would be preferable

- Modeling and interpretation of TDCs always difficult, especially if
exogeneity is unclear, e.g.
  - although nutrition is provided by hospital staff, amount provided might
  depend on patients' health status
  - more recent values provide better confounder adjustment but may also
  be fully indicative of the outcome (indication bias)

- Model choice becomes difficult when all effects are potentially non-linear
and/or non-linearly time-varying (boosting ad double-penalty procedures
promising)
