# Introduction
- It can be shown that under certain conditions (and after appropriate data preparation)
the Cox model ([Cox, 1972](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0035-9246\%281972\%2934\%3A2\%3C187\%3ARMAL\%3E2.0.CO\%3B2-6)) can be estimated using Poisson Regression

- Such models are called *Piece-wise Exponential Models* (PEM);
[Whitehead (1980)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2346901); [Friedman (1982)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2240502)

- PEMs have some disadvantages (compared to Cox regression), but can be improved
by switching to *Piece-wise exponential Additive (Mixed) Models* (PA(M)Ms),
where the baseline hazard (and time-varying effects) are estimated by penalized
splines

- Essentially, this allows the usage of methods and inference procedures
developed for Generalized Additive (Mixed) Models (GAM(M)s) in the context
of time-to-event data analysis (e.g., use `mgcv::gam` or `mboost` for estimation)

- PAMMs are powerful, but data pre-processing and model evaluation can be
cumbersome due to data structure (and lack of readily available tools/software)

- The **`pammtools`** package provides utility functions that facilitate
working with PAMMs

# Introduction

- The `tumor` data from the **`pammtools`** package contains:
  - right-censored time-until death (`days`)
  - status indicator (`status`, 0 = censored, 1 = died)
  - covariates: `charlson_score` (Comorbidities),
  `age`, `sex`, `complications`, `metastases`, ...

# Introduction
- Thus, such time-to-event data can be summarized by
  - tuples `\((t, \delta)\)`, where
      - `\(t\)` (`days`) indicates the time until the event (or censoring/truncation)
      - `\(\delta\)` (`status`) the status at time `\(t\)` (often `\(\delta \in \{0, 1\}\)`)
  - covariates `\(x\)` (e.g., `age`)

- "Standard" time-to-event analysis models the *hazard rate* &lt;br&gt;
  `$$\lambda(t; x) = \lambda_0(t)\exp(\beta \cdot x)$$`

  `\(\ra \exp(\beta)\)`: Multiplicative increase of the hazard for 1 unit increase of `\(x\)` (c.p.)

- Other quantities can be derived from the hazard rate
  - Cumulative Hazard: `\(\Lambda(t;x) = \int_{0}^{t} \lambda(s;x)\mathrm{d}s\)`
  - Survival Probability: `\(S(t;x) = \exp(-\Lambda(t;x)) = 1 - F(t)\)`

---
# Introduction
Analysis of such data is complicated because

- `\(t\)` cannot be observed fully (left-truncation, left-censoring, right-censoring, ...)

- competing events (other than the one of interest) can occur (recurrently)
    during the observation period (Competing Risks, Multistate Models)

- it takes time to observe `\(t\)`, consequently:

  - the effect of a covariate (observed at `\(t=0\)`) can change over time &lt;br&gt;
    `\(\ra\)` *time-varying effects* (TVE): `\(\lambda(t;x) = \lambda_0(t)\exp(\beta(t)\cdot x)\)`

  - covariates can change over time &lt;br&gt;
    `\(\ra\)` *time-dependent covariates* (TDC): `\(\lambda(t;\bfz) = \lambda_0(t)\exp(\beta \cdot z(t))\)`

  - combination of both &lt;br&gt;
  `\(\ra\)` *concurrent effects*: `\(\lambda(t;x) = \lambda_0(t)\exp(\beta(t) * z(t))\)` &lt;br&gt;
  `\(\ra\)` *cumulative effects* (later)

---
# Time-varying effect (TVE)
- The effect of a covariate observed (only) at the beginning of the follow-up `\((t=0)\)`
changes over the course of the follow-up:
`$$\lambda(t; x) = \lambda_0(t)\exp(\beta(t)\cdot x)$$`

- Often, this is the case for *scores* that describe a patient's health status
  at time of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU)/hospital
  - highly indicative of survival at the beginning of the follow-up

  - During the follow-up, the initial health status changes (due to treatment),
  thus the effect tends to go to zero over time (unless score describes conditions
  that worsen over time/can not be improved by treatment)

&lt;!--   - Usually, one assumes that `\(\beta(t)\)` is a smooth
  function, thus we denote TVEs by `\(f(t)\)` --&gt;

  - Example: `veteran` data (see [time-varying effects vignette](https://adibender.github.io/pammtools/articles/tveffects.html) for details and code) &lt;br/&gt;
  `\(\ra\)` Effect of the
  &lt;a href="image/p_karno_tv2.jpeg" align="middle"&gt; Karnofsky performance score over time&lt;/a&gt;


---
# Time-dependent covariates (TDC)

- The covariate is observed not only at the beginning of the follow-up `\((t=0)\)`
but also at different time-points during the follow-up:
.font80[
`$$\lambda(t; \bfz) = \lambda_0(t)\exp(\beta\cdot z(t))$$`
]
- Biomarkers, continuously updated clinical scores, ...

- often difficult to model:
  - updates irregular/different for different subjects (irregular grid)
  - no information on covariate values between updates

- Example `recidivism` data ([Rossi, Berk, and Lenihan, 1980](#bib-Rossi1980); [Fox and Weisberg, 2011](#bib-Fox2011))
  - 432 subjects released from prison where followed for 52 weeks
  - Each week the subjects' employment status was recorded
  `\(z(t)\in \{0,1\}, t = 1,\ldots,52\)`
  - See [vignette on time-dependent covariates](https://adibender.github.io/pammtools/articles/tdcovar.html) for details

---
# Cumulative Effects

- Let `\(z(\tz)\)` the value of a time-dependent covariate observed at
exposure time point `\(\tz\)`
- e.g., `\(z(\tz=1)=0.2, z(\tz=2) = 2.7, z(\tz=3) = 1.3, \ldots\)`
- The hazard at time `\(t=3\)` with a simple cumulative effect could be something like

.font90[
`$$\lambda(t=3;\bfz) = \lambda_0(t=3)\exp(\beta_1 z(\tz=1) + \beta_2 z(\tz=2) + \beta_3z(\tz=3))$$`
]

- However, usually we would expect that past observations are weighted by
a smooth function (that decreases with latency):

.font90[
`$$\lambda(t; \bfz) = \lambda_0(t)\exp\left(\sum_{\tz \leq t} h(t-\tz)z(\tz)\right)$$`

- the *partial effect* `\(h(t-\tz)\)` can again be estimated from the data via
penalized splines

]

---
# The Piece-wise Exponential Model (PEM)

The idea of the PEM is to

- divide the follow-up in `\(J\)` intervals `\((\kappa_{j-1}, \kappa_{j}], j=1,\ldots,J\)`

- create pseudo observations *pseudo-observations*
`$$\delta_{ij} =
  \begin{cases}
    1, &amp;\text{ if } t_i \in (\kappa_{j-1}, \kappa_j] \wedge \delta_i = 1\\
    0, &amp;\text{ else }
  \end{cases}$$`
and offsets `\(o_{ij} = \log(t_{ij})\)`,
  where `\(t_{ij} = \min(\kappa_j-\kappa_{j-1}, t_i-\kappa_{j-1})\)`

- estimate piece-wise constant hazards in each interval `\((\kappa_{j-1}, \kappa_j]\)`

- Survival times with (piece-wise) constant hazards have (piece-wise) exponential
distribution

---
# The PEM: Example


- Consider survival times following a Weibull distribution `\(T \sim WB(\alpha = 1.5, \lambda = 10)\)`

- The follow-up is partitioned in 10 Intervals `\((0,1], (1,2], \ldots, (9,10]\)`

# PEM Example III


Even if approximation of the hazard is relatively crude, the approximation
of the cumulative hazard (piece-wise linear) and the survival probability
(piece-wise exponential) are usually good:

&lt;img src="pammtools-slides-2018-06_files/figure-html/ex-pem-1-1.png" height="300px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
# PEM Example IV
- (In theory) approximation of the hazard function becomes better with increasing
number of intervals (and `\(n\ra \infty\)`)

- In practice (finite `\(n\)`):
    - interval-specific hazard estimates become unstable
    - number of parameters increases
    - results sensitive to the placement and frequency of follow-up split points

# Custom visualization

- &lt;a href="https://adibender.github.io/pammtools/reference/newdata.html"&gt;`?make_newdata`&lt;/a&gt;

  - creates data set with specified covariate values (functions can be used)
  - sets all other covariates to mean values/reference category

- `add_*` functions add quantity of interest, e.g.,
  - `add_term`: term contribution to the log-hazard
  - `add_hazard`/`add_cumu_hazard`: Hazard and cumulative hazard
  - `add_surv_prob`: Survival probabilities




```r
# create newdata
new_df &lt;- ped_tumor %&gt;%
  make_newdata(tend=unique(tend), complications=unique(complications)) %&gt;%
  group_by(complications) %&gt;% #necessary for correct cumulative hazard and survival

# Cumulative effects

- In general the partial effect can be a tri-variate function of
  - `\(\tz\)` time at which exposure was observed
  - `\(z(\tz)\)` the value of the exposure observed at time `\(\tz\)`
  - `\(t\)` the follow-up time

- The cumulative effect is obtained by integrating over all `\(\tz\)` within a
pre-specified time-window `\(\mathcal{T}(t)\)`

`$$g(\bfz, t) = \int_{\mathcal{T}(t)} h(t, \tz, z(\tz))\mathrm{d}\tz \approx \sum_{\tz \in \mathcal{T}(t)} \Delta_{\tz}h(t,\tz,z(\tz))$$`

&lt;a href = "pammtools-slides-2018-06_files/figure-html/LL-ex-0-1.png"&gt;


```r
gg_laglead(0:10, tz=0:9, ll_fun = function(t, tz) {t &gt;= tz})
```
&lt;/a&gt;

---
# Cumulative effects


- Consider simulated data were a covariate was observed at time points
`\(\tz \in \{-5,-4,\ldots, 0, \ldots, 4, 5\}\)` (relative to the beginning of the
follow-up)

- The true hazard is given by
`\(\lambda(t; \bfz) = \lambda_0(t)\exp\left(\cdots + \sum_{\tz \leq t} h(t-\tz)z(\tz)\right)\)`

# Cumulative effects III

To estimate a cumulative effect of `z.tz` (using `mgcv`), the data has to be
transformed into a special PED format with matrix columns



```r

  data = simdf_wce,
  formula = Surv(time, status) ~ x1 + x2| cumulative(latency(tz), z.tz, tz_var="tz",

  cut = seq(0, 10, by = 1))
str(ped, 1, give.attr=FALSE)
```

```
## Classes 'fped', 'ped' and 'data.frame':	4232 obs. of  11 variables:
