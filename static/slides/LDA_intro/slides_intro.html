# What is Life-time Data Analysis (LDA)?

- LDA is a collection of statistical procedures to investigate data where
"the outcome variable of interest is *time until an event occurs*" &lt;/br&gt;
(Kleinbaum 2005)

- A more general name would be *Time-to-event Analysis*

- Historically  the first applications of time-to-event analysis
considered the outcome *time until death*, thus called *Survival Analysis*

- Other synonyms:
  + event history analysis

  + duration time models

  + failure time models


---
# What is Life-time Data Analysis (LDA)?

- **time** until an event can be measured in different units (resolution)
  - years
  - milliseconds
  - days
  - ...

- possible **events** include

  + Death after operation (yes/no)

  + Recidivism (Rearrest after release from prison)

  + Leaving a web page (after following a link on social media)

  + ...

- Sometimes, an event can not be observed for all observational units.&lt;/br&gt;
`\(\rightarrow\)` In these cases the observation is *censored* (more later)

# Data Examples: Melanoma (Andersen 1993)
Source: P. K. Andersen, O. Borgan, R. D. Gill and N. Keiding (1993)
Statistical Models based on Counting Processes. Springer.

- 205 patients with malignant melanoma (skin cancer) at University of Odense,
Denmark

- Complete removal of the cancer (+ 2.5 cm skin around it)

- Study begin 1962. All patients were followed until the end of 1977

- Outcome: Survival time in days/Time until death

- Covariates:
  + sex (1 = male, 0 = female)
  + age (in years)
  + ...

- Available in **R** from the `MASS` package

# Description of event time distribution
Let `\(T\geq 0\)` a continuous, non-negative random variable. &lt;/br&gt;

The distribution of `\(T\)` can be described by its

  a) density function: `\(f_T(t) := f(t)\)`

  b) cumulative distribution function (CDF):
  `\(F_T(t) := F(t) := \mathbb{P}(T \leq t)\)`

  c) survival function:
`$$S_T(t) := S(t) := \mathbb{P}(T \geq t) = 1 - F(t) \hspace14em (1.1)$$`
  d) hazard rate:
`$$\lambda_T(t):=\lambda(t) := \lim\limits_{\Delta t \searrow 0}{\frac{1}{\Delta t}}\mathbb{P}(t\leq T&lt;t+\Delta t|T\geq t)\hspace8.5em (1.2)$$`
  e) cumulative hazard rate:
`$$\Lambda_T(t):=\Lambda(t) := \int_{0}^{t}{\lambda(u)du} \hspace17.5em (1.3)$$`

# Description of event time distributions
**Example: Melanoma Data**

&lt;img src="slides_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- Usually, the *Survivor function* `\(S(t)\)` is interpreted, e.g.,
  - Median survival time, i.e., time `\(t\)` for which `\(S(t)=0.5\)`, equals 2000 days
  - The probability of surviving more than 3000 days after the operation equals
  25%
- Properties of `\(S(t)\)`:
  + monotonously descreasing
  + `\(S(0):=1\)`; `\(S(t) \rightarrow 0\)` for `\(t \rightarrow \infty\)`


---
# Description of event time distributions
**Example: Melanoma Data**
- The *hazard rate* `\(\lambda(t)\)` "is particularly useful [...] for describing the
way the chance of experiencing the event changes with time."
(Moeschberger and Klein, 1997)
- `\(\lambda(t) \geq 0\)`
- compared to the survival function, hazard rate often better suited to
interpret covariate effects

---
# Hazard, density and survival
The quantities `\(f(t)\)`, `\(F(t)\)`, `\(S(t)\)`, `\(\lambda(t)\)` and `\(\Lambda(t)\)` are related and uniquely define a distribution through:

`$$\lambda(t)=\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)}=\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}\hspace10em (1.4)$$`

`$$S(t)=\exp(- \Lambda(t))=\exp\left(-\int_0^t\lambda(u) \ du \right)\hspace2.5em (1.5)$$`

`$$f(t)= - \, \frac{d S(t)}{dt} \label{f_dSt}\hspace14.5em (1.6)$$`

---
# Proof
We prove how we get from (1.4) to (1.6)
`\begin{eqnarray*}
\lambda(t)  &amp;=&amp; \lim_{\Delta t\searrow 0} \frac{1}{\Delta t} \mathbb{P}(t\leq T&lt;t+\Delta t\,|\,T\geq t)\\
            &amp;=&amp; \lim_{\Delta t\searrow 0}\frac{1}{\Delta t}\frac{\mathbb{P}(\{t\leq T&lt;t+\Delta t\} \cap \{T\geq t\})}{\mathbb{P}(T\geq t)}\\
            &amp;=&amp; \lim_{\Delta t\searrow 0}\frac{1}{\Delta t}\cdot
            \frac{\mathbb{P}(t\leq T &lt; t+\Delta t)}{\mathbb{P}(T\geq t)}\\
            &amp;=&amp; \underbrace{\lim_{\Delta t\searrow 0}\frac{(F(t+\Delta t)-F(t))}{\Delta t}}_{\text{f(t)}}\cdot \frac{1}{S(t)}=\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}
\end{eqnarray*}`

---
# Proof (2)
`\begin{eqnarray*}
\Lambda(t)  &amp;=&amp; \int_0^t\lambda(u) \ du \;=\; \int_0^t \frac{f(u)}{S(u)} \ du \;=\; \int_0^t\frac{f(u)}{1-F(u)} \ du\\
            &amp;\stackrel{*}{=}&amp; -\Big[\log\big(1-F(u)\big)\Big]_0^t \;=\; -\log\big(1-F(t)\big) \\
            &amp;=&amp; -\log\big(S(t)\big) \Leftrightarrow  S(t)=\exp\big(-\Lambda(t)\big)\\
            &amp; &amp; \qquad \stackrel{*}{} \mbox{since } \int \frac{g'(x)}{g(x)} \ dx
            = \log (g(x)) \text{ with } g(x)=1-F(x) \\
\end{eqnarray*}`
&lt;/br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

f(t) &amp;=&amp;\frac{dF(t)}{dt}=\frac{d(1-S(t))}{dt}=-\frac{dS(t)}{dt}

# Exponential distribution (1)
`\(T \sim Exp(\lambda)\)`, with rate `\(\lambda\)`

Applications:

- a) Time between the occurence of events in a Poisson process &lt;/br&gt;
(events occur continuously and independently at a constant rate).

- b) Lifetime of non-aging objects (e.g. lamps, electronic devices).

Hazard rate: `\(\lambda(t)\equiv\lambda\)` &lt;/br&gt;
Survival function: `\(S(t)=\exp\left(-\int_0^t\lambda(u)\ du\right)=\exp(-\lambda t)\)`&lt;/br&gt;
Distribution function: `\(F(t)=1-\exp(-\lambda t)\)`&lt;/br&gt;
Density: `\(f(t)=\lambda \cdot \exp(-\lambda t)\)`


---
# Exponential distribution (2)
Quantile function:
`$$Q(p) = q_p = S^{-1}(1-p) = - \frac{1}{\lambda} \log(1-p)$$`
&lt;/br&gt;

Moments: `$$\mathbb{E}(T)=\frac{1}{\lambda}$$`
    `$$\mathbb{V}(T)=\frac{1}{\lambda^2}=\left(\mathbb{E}(T)\right)^2$$`

---
# Exponential distribution (3)
&lt;img src="slides_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Weibull distribution (1)
`\(T \sim WB(\alpha, \lambda)\)`&lt;/br&gt;

Applications:
- Lifetime of objects with a hazard proportional to a power of time (industry,
material science).

- Flexible lifetime modelling in medicine (e.g. time to remission).

&lt;/br&gt;

Hazard rate: `\(\lambda(t)=\lambda\cdot \alpha (\lambda t)^{\alpha-1}\)`&lt;/br&gt;

Survival function: `\(S(t)=\exp(-(\lambda t)^{\alpha})\)`&lt;/br&gt;

Density: `\(f(t)=\lambda \cdot \alpha(\lambda t)^{\alpha-1} \exp(-(\lambda t)^ {\alpha})\)`&lt;/br&gt;

---
# Weibull distribution (2)
Quantile function: &lt;/br&gt;
`$$Q(p) = \frac{1}{\lambda} [-\log(1-p)]^\frac{1}{\alpha}$$`&lt;/br&gt;

Moments:&lt;/br&gt;
  `$$\mathbb{E}(T) = \frac{\Gamma(\frac{1+\alpha}{\alpha})} {\lambda}$$`
  `$$\mathbb{V}(T) = \frac{\Gamma(\frac{\alpha+2}{\alpha})-(\Gamma(\frac{\alpha+1}{\alpha}))^2}{\lambda^2}$$`&lt;/br&gt;

For `\(\alpha, \lambda&gt;0\)`, if `\(Y \sim Exp(\lambda)\)`, we get
`$$Z = Y^c \sim WB(\lambda, \frac{1}{c})\quad (c&gt;0)\ .$$`

---
# Weibull distribution (3)
&lt;img src="slides_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Log-normal distribution (1)
`\(T \sim LN(\mu,\sigma^2)\)`&lt;/br&gt;

Application:
- Problematic, since the hazard rate is a hump-shaped function, which is
possibly implausible.

For `\(Y\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)\)` and `\(T:=\exp(Y)\)`, `\(T \sim LN(\mu,\sigma^2)\)`.&lt;/br&gt;

Hazard rate: `\(\dfrac{f(t)}{S(t)}\)`

Survival function: `\(S(t)=1-\Phi(\dfrac{ln(t)-\mu}{\sigma})\)`, `\(\Phi\)` distribution function of standard normal

Density:
`\(f(t)=\frac{1}{t \sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{(\log t -\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right), \quad \text{for } t&gt;0\ .\)`

---
# Log-normal distribution (2)
Moments:

`$$\mathbb{E}(T)=\exp\left(\mu + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\right)$$`

`$$\mathbb{V}(T)=\exp\left(2\mu + \sigma^2\right)(exp(\sigma^2)-1)$$`

Note, if `\(\mathbb{E}=\mathbb{E}(T)\)` is the mean value and `\(\mathbb{V}=\mathbb{V}(T)\)` is the variance, then

`\begin{eqnarray*}
  \sigma^2 &amp; = &amp; \log\left(\frac{\mathbb{V}}{\mathbb{E}^2} + 1\right) \\
  \mu &amp; = &amp; \log(\mathbb{E}) - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\ = \ \log\left(\mathbb{E}^2 \sqrt{\frac{1}{\mathbb{V} + \mathbb{E}^2}}\right) \\
\end{eqnarray*}`

---
# Log-normal distribution (3)
&lt;img src="slides_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Gamma distribution (1)
`\(T \sim \Gamma(b,c)\)`&lt;/br&gt;

Application:
- Flexible models in medicine and industry, similar to the Weibull distribution.
Hazard rate:
`\(\lambda(t)=\frac{\big(\frac{t}{b}\big)^{c-1}}{b\cdot(c-1)!\Big(\sum_{j=0}^{c-1} \big(\frac{t}{b}\big)^j \frac{1}{j!}\Big)}\)`

Survival function: `\(S(t)=1-\bigg[\exp\Big(-\frac{t}{b}\Big)\bigg]\cdot\bigg[\sum_{j=0}^{c-1}\Big(\frac{t}{b}\Big)^j\cdot \frac{1}{j!}\bigg]\)`

Density: `\(f(t)=\frac{1}{b\ \Gamma(c)} \cdot \Big(\frac{t}{b}\Big)^{c-1}\cdot \exp\Big(-\frac{t}{b}\Big) \quad b,c&gt;0\)`

Moments: `\(\quad \mathbb{E}(T) = b \cdot c \quad \quad \mathbb{V}(T) = b^2 c\)`

For `\(c \in \mathbb{N}\)` results the *Erlang distribution*.

# Outline
1. Introduction and basics
  - Examples
  - Duration time distributions
  - **Censoring**

---
# Censoring
In many studies:
  - patients are still alive (at the hospital) at the end of the study
  - patients are "lost" to follow-up after some time

`\(\rightarrow\)` Instead of observing `\(T\)`, we only know that `\(T &gt; c\)`&lt;/br&gt;
`\(\Rightarrow\)` **Right-censoring**:

Let
  - `\(T_i \stackrel{i.i.d.}{\sim}F\)`: event times
  - `\(C_i \stackrel{i.i.d.}{\sim} G\)`: censoring times

with `\(F\)` and `\(G\)` distribution functions in `\(\mathbb{R}^{+}\)`

We observe `\(t_i=\min (T_i,C_i)\)`,  and define the event/censoring indicator
`$$\delta_i=\begin{cases} 1,\; \mbox{$t_i$=$T_i$} \\ 0,\;
\mbox{$t_i$=$C_i$}\end{cases} \;$$`

---
# Censoring Example: Melanoma Data
- Until now we assumed, that the event time was observed for all patients
- However, many patients were lost to follow-up before the event could be
observed (`status` variable)
- Accounting for right-censoring, strongly affects Survival function estimation

&lt;img src="slides_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Censoring: Type I and II
&lt;/br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**Type I censoring**:
All individuals are observed until a fixed time `\(c\)`.&lt;/br&gt;
- Example 1: Recidivism data (follow-up of 52 weeks)
- Example 2: Patients are observed until day 60 after admission to the hospital.
&lt;/br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**Type II censoring**:
The study continues until the failure of `\(r&lt;n\)` individuals.&lt;/br&gt;
- Seldomly applied, since an open-ended random study time is generally
impractical from a management point of view.

---
# Censoring: Type III

We observe `\(T_i\)` if `\(T_i \leq C_i\)`.

**Assumption**: `\(T_i\)` and `\(C_i\)` are independent&lt;/br&gt;
 `\(\Rightarrow\)` random censoring &lt;/br&gt;

Example:
  - `\(T\)`: Survival time
  - `\(C\)`: Time of leaving the study (e.g. due to relocation)

&lt;/br&gt;
**Assumption**: `\(T_i\)` and `\(C_i\)` are not independent&lt;/br&gt;
`\(\Rightarrow\)` competing risk censoring&lt;/br&gt;

Example:
  - `\(T\)`: Survival time
  - `\(C\)`: Time of hospital discharge

---
# Censoring: Other types

**Interval censoring**: &lt;/br&gt;
- The event is known to have occurred in an interval.&lt;/br&gt;
- Example:
    - In a study, an examination is carried out every year.
    - One patient showed up for examination only at years 1 and 4.
    - If an event is observed in the 4th year, we can tell that the event
    occured in the interval `\((1,4)\)`, but it is impossible to specify the
    exact time of the event.

**Left-censoring**:&lt;/br&gt;
- The event is known to have occurred at a certain time point, however there is
no information about its presence at earlier time points (Example: AIDS/HIV).

- Note: It is important to distinguish between left-censoring and
**left-truncation** (units are below certain level of detection;
survival time `\(&lt; t_0\)` is not observed).
